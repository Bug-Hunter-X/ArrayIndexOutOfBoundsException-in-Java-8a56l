# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its defined bounds. The corrected version is provided in `FixedArray.java`. This is a simple example to illustrate a frequent source of runtime errors in Java applications.  Understanding array bounds is crucial for writing robust and error-free code.
